# implot-rs

ðŸš§ **Work in progress, check back later (or open an issue if you'd like to collaborate)** ðŸš§ 


Initial attempt at creating Rust bindings for https://github.com/epezent/implot. 

At this point, raw bindings are working in implot-sys, and there is a test example 
(just an adapted version of imgui-rs' example) that calls into them for trying things
out. More idiomatic bindings will be built next.
